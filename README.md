ðŸš€ Excited to share my **Student Management Mini Project**! ðŸŽ“  

This project gave me hands-on experience with **backend development using Java & Spring Boot**. I implemented:  

âœ… Core Java, MySQL/H2  
âœ… Spring Boot (REST APIs, Data JPA, Profiles, Actuators)  
âœ… Exception Handling & Validations  
âœ… Logging with SLF4J  
âœ… Unit Testing with **JUnit 5 + Mockito**  
âœ… Achieved **69% code coverage** with **JaCoCo**  

ðŸ“¹ Iâ€™ve also created a short demo video with captions to showcase the project in action.  

ðŸ‘‰ Check out the project here: [GitHub Link]  

Iâ€™m continuously learning and working towards becoming an **industry-ready backend/full-stack developer**.  
Any feedback or suggestions would be highly appreciated

Do you want me to also **suggest how to upload and share your demo video on GitHub (via README link)** so recruiters can see it directly from your repo?
